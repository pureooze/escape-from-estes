##Escape From Estes

Coded in C++ and QT, play as a messenger attempting to escape from the city of Estes

##What will it be like?
This will likely just be a terminal adventure game that features puzzles that the player will have to solve in order to progress.
Previously there were no plans of using a GUI but I have discovered, to my great pleasure, that QT is very easy to work with and actually makes it easier to
develop a state machine (mainly by already having a StateMachine class ready).

##Installation
At the moment you will have to compile from source using an IDE or manually if you wish. I will provide a binary later on once I get stuff going but for now there is no need because the code seems to change completely almost every night.
