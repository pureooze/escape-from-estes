##Escape From Estes

Coded in C++ and QT, play as a messenger attempting to escape from the city of Estes

##What will it be like?
This will likely just be an adventure game that features puzzles that the player will have to solve in order to progress.
Previously there were no plans of using a GUI but I have discovered, to my great pleasure, that QT is very easy to work with and actually makes it easier to
develop a state machine (mainly by already having a StateMachine class ready).

##Installation
At the moment you will have to compile from source using an IDE or manually if you wish. If you wish to just download a binary please visit
