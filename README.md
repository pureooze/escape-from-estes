##Escape From Estes

Coded in C++, play as a messenger attempting to escape from the city of Estes

##What will it be like?
This will likely just be a terminal adventure game that features puzzles that the player will have to solve in order to progress.
There are no plants to add a GUI because it is tedious work and is not needed for a game like this, where the player has to make simple, predifined choices.

##Installation
At the moment you will have to compile from source using an IDE or manually if you wish. You can try running the binary in the bin folder but it will probably not work for you.
